### Handling Life Coaching Prompts

The chatbot distinguishes between prompts related to life coaching and those that are not using the `isLifeCoachingRelated` function.

If the user's prompt is identified as related to life coaching, the chatbot engages in a thoughtful and personalized response using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

#### `isLifeCoachingRelated(prompt)`

Checks if a given prompt is related to life coaching topics.

```javascript
/**
 * Checks if a given prompt is related to life coaching topics.
 * @param {string} prompt - The user's input prompt to evaluate.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the prompt is related to life coaching, false otherwise.
 */
async function isLifeCoachingRelated(prompt) {
  try {
    let responseContent = "";

    // Create a chat completion with a system message to evaluate the relevance of the prompt
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: `Evaluate if the prompt is related to life coaching topics: "${prompt}". Respond with yes or no.`,
        },
      ],
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    });

    // Extract and normalize the response content
    responseContent += completion.choices[0].message.content
      .trim()
      .toLowerCase();

    console.log(responseContent);

    // Return true if the model's response is "yes," indicating that the prompt is related to life coaching
    return responseContent === "yes";
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error checking life coaching relevance:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

#### `callThisFunction(prompt)`

Handles prompts related to life coaching by utilizing the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

```javascript
/**
 * Handles prompts related to life coaching by utilizing the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
 * @param {string} prompt - The user's input prompt to handle.
 * @returns {string} - The response generated by the chatbot.
 */
async function callThisFunction(prompt) {
  try {
    let responseContent = "";

    // Create a chat completion with the provided prompt
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: prompt,
        },
      ],
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    });

    // Extract the response content
    responseContent += completion.choices[0].message.content;
    console.log(responseContent);

    return responseContent;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    throw new Error("Internal Server Error");
  }
}
```

### Handling Non-Life Coaching Prompts

For any issues or questions unrelated to life coaching, the chatbot gracefully handles the conversation using default logic.
